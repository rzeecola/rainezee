            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h6> Raine Angeline B. Zaldivar, a 20-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a specialization in Web and Mobile Applications at FEU Institute of Technology, is a dedicated and passionate individual with a strong commitment to both her academic and personal interests. <br> <br>
                Her interest in photography was ignited in the 6th grade when she represented her school and the City of Valenzuela in "Pagkuha ng Larawang Pampahayagan 2016." She achieved 2nd place at the District-Based Schools Press Conference (SPC), 7th place at the Division Schools Press Conference (DSPC), and a participant in the Regional Schools Press Conference (RSPC) that same year, which sparked a lasting passion for the photojournalism. <br> <br>
                Raine developed her skills further as a co-founder of Kuhaku Media, a media organization created by her and a friend that aimed on event and photo journalism. Her role in the organization reflects her dedication on her talent in documenting unique and raw stories. <br> <br>
